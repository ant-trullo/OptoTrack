OptoTrack_v1.0 is an image analysis platform developed to detect and track transcriptional sites in opto genetic stack acquisitions. This software is written in Pythonâ„¢ 3.10.

OptoTrack_v1.0 was developed on the operating system Linux Ubuntu 24.04 64-bit and tested on Linux Ubuntu 24.04.

Requirements: OptoTrack_v1.0 is written in Python3.10, but should work as well with newer versions of Python3. All the packages used by this software (with their version) are listed in the file requirements.txt: to install all of them should be sufficient to run the command 'pip install -r requirements.txt' in your console. In order to compile the cython function, a C++ compiler is needed. For Linux or Mac users, you need to install the package gcc, for Windows users instead you need to install the visualstudio compiler (you can follow this guide https://wiki.python.org/moin/WindowsCompilers).

Install OptoTrack_v1.0: Clone the repository and put all the files in a folder, then open a terminal (or the cmd command prompt for Windows users) and move into the folder and run the command 'python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace'. This will compile the Cython files.

Run OptoTrack_v1.0: Open a terminal (or cmd for Windows) move in the software folder and run 'python3 OptoTrack_GUI_v1_0.py' and press enter. The graphical user interface will pop up and let you work.

Possible issues: Depending on the size of your data and the specifications of your computer, you can have a MemoryError. In this case try to shut down all the other tasks your pc is running and eventually crop your data.
